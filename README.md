# Qodo Merge Deep Dive Testing Project

A comprehensive testing environment designed to evaluate Qodo Merge's (PR Agent) AI code review capabilities through real-world scenarios with intentionally flawed code.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains a realistic user management application with intentional security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and code quality problems. It's specifically designed to test Qodo Merge's ability to identify and suggest improvements for common development issues.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **API Layer**: FastAPI with authentication endpoints
- **Database Layer**: SQLite/PostgreSQL with ORM operations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with session management
- **Utilities**: Common functions for file operations and calculations

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- **Components**: User forms and data tables
- **Utilities**: Validation and helper functions
- **State Management**: React hooks and context

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Multi-container setup with database
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated Qodo Merge reviews
- **Testing**: Pytest and Jest with intentional gaps

## üö® Intentional Issues by Category

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Direct string interpolation in database queries
- **XSS**: Unsafe HTML rendering with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- **Command Injection**: Unsafe subprocess execution
- **Eval Usage**: Direct evaluation of user input
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys and passwords in source code
- **Weak Authentication**: MD5 hashing and predictable tokens
- **Directory Traversal**: Unsafe file operations
- **Information Disclosure**: Detailed error messages and debug endpoints

### Performance Issues
- **N+1 Queries**: Inefficient database access patterns
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: O(n¬≤) algorithms where O(n log n) exists
- **Memory Leaks**: Unbounded cache growth and unclosed connections
- **Inefficient Rendering**: Missing React optimization patterns
- **Blocking Operations**: Synchronous processing of large datasets
- **Missing Virtualization**: Large lists without pagination

### Code Quality Issues
- **Poor Error Handling**: Silent failures and exposed stack traces
- **Type Safety**: `any` types and missing interfaces in TypeScript
- **Missing Validation**: No input sanitization or boundary checks
- **Code Duplication**: Repeated logic across modules
- **Poor Naming**: Unclear variable and function names
- **Missing Documentation**: Undocumented complex functions

### Infrastructure Problems
- **Docker Security**: Running as root, outdated base images
- **Dependency Issues**: Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
- **Configuration**: Hardcoded credentials in docker-compose
